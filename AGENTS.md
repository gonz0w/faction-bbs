# Faction BBS agent guide

## Read first

Read `README.md`, `docs/project.md`, `docs/security-privacy.md`, `dev-docs/roadmap.md`, and the relevant GitHub issue before proposing or changing work. Follow `dev-docs/workflow.md`. This is a research-stage project; no production stack is selected and there is no runnable BBS yet.

## Product constraints

- Preserve the WWIV-inspired approved-login -> BBS-specific ANSI art -> sysop-defined welcome/menu session. No community access before authentication and local sysop approval.
- Use Citadel-style message rooms, IRC-style command-driven chat, BBS menus, local file areas/mail, and optional isolated game doors. Existing games are reuse candidates, not implemented support claims.
- Keep each sysop's identity, accounts/approval, content, files, games, directory, and local-only chat local. Only explicitly participating shared chat channels may federate in the future.
- Direct network-terminal access is central. A browser portal/console is a goal that must be optional and may be private or disabled. Do not assume public HTTP exposure.
- Privacy, security, exportability, low bandwidth, and lightweight operation are requirements. Use minimal opt-in telemetry; never log message bodies, credentials, or private content by default.
- No JavaScript/TypeScript in source, tooling, dependencies, or browser-terminal assets. Do not introduce Node/npm, JS terminal libraries, or JS-based CI actions. Browser-console feasibility must be researched within this constraint.
- Prioritize tiny working sets and bounded per-session work. The owner research target is 1–2 cores / about 1 GiB host RAM and 100–250 connected members; do not treat host capacity as application allowance or claim supported capacity. Compare low-memory native options, selective assembly and specialized systems with equivalent security/behavior. External helpers/blockchain are research candidates, never implicit permission to publish private data or add a mandatory service.
- Evaluate fast, lightweight language/runtime options comparatively. Do not choose a stack, storage engine, protocol, federation topology, or scripting runtime from familiarity.
- Keep community behavior independent of addressing, discovery, routing, connection mechanics, and optional transport adapters. Mesh/non-IP support remains future research.
- Honor the ANSI/ASCII, underground scene, and sysop customization direction without trading away access control, accessibility, or a usable plain-text baseline.

## Work and documentation

- GitHub Issues are the canonical backlog and task status. `docs/` holds current product/member/sysop information; `dev-docs/` holds engineering, research, decisions, plans, and roadmap context.
- Historical records under `dev-docs/archive/` are read-only context, never current instructions or an active backlog. The old planning workflow and slash commands are retired. Do not recreate a `.planning/` directory.
- Use a short issue-linked branch and focused PR. For multi-step work, keep a self-contained execution plan under `dev-docs/plans/` using the template; routine edits do not need a plan.
- For material decisions, record the question, constraints, alternatives, primary sources with retrieval dates, tradeoffs, confidence, reversal cost, and falsifiable validation. Separate product decisions from untested technical hypotheses.
- Update `README.md` status, affected docs, and `CHANGELOG.md` in the same change when scope, behavior, setup, support, or stage changes. Review README freshness on every PR. Do not claim security, game, network, or platform support without evidence.
- Do not expand an issue into a full platform rewrite. Capture additional work in an issue and cross-reference existing work before duplicating it. Future candidates are not automatic first-release commitments.

## Checks and safety

- Run `python3 tools/check_repository.py` for repository/documentation changes. Run the smallest meaningful additional checks for the affected prototype/code once introduced; report unavailable checks plainly.
- Never commit credentials, actual deployment endpoints, user data, private artwork, generated secrets, or unlicensed third-party assets. Public repository visibility must not imply public deployment visibility.
- Keep legacy games/extensions optional, permission-bounded, and failure-isolated. Treat input, file uploads, terminal control sequences, and remote channel traffic as untrusted.
- During review, prioritize approval bypasses, accidental public exposure, local-data federation, JS/TS dependencies, unsafe terminal/file handling, and unsupported status claims.
